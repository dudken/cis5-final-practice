## Tic Tac Toe

A simple Tic-tac-toe game implemented with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Files:
- `index.html` — main game page
- `styles.css` — styling
- `script.js` — game logic (two-player + simple computer opponent)

Run locally:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use `xdg-open`):

```bash
xdg-open index.html
```

2. Or serve with a simple HTTP server (recommended when using extensions):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```
